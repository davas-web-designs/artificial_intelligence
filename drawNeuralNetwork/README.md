# Drawing a Neural Network
## OctopuDNA
Includes sliders that make it easy to modify the number of nodes on each layer and even the number of hidden layers!

It will include a way to take into account the weights of each connection and modify the thickness and color of the lines that connect each neuron so that it is very easy to visualize what is going on.

Feel free to play around with it!
